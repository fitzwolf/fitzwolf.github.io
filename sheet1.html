            <h1>About This Project</h1>
            <p>Traditional wisdom has suggested that precious metals such as 
                silver and gold are a good recession resistant investment. But they
                often do not produce as much gain during times of prosperity. So a question
                of interest is whether it is worth investing in silver and gold to protect
                for recessions are if there are other options that might also work. To answer
                this I have looked at how well an investment in silver as compared to other
                blue chip stocks (apple and microsoft) as well as an etf that tracks the S&P 500
                closely to see what impact they have on your overall gains. To look specifically
                at recession impact the data used will start from the beginning of the Great Recession.
